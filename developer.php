            <h1>Message from the Developer</h1>
            <p><em>Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem</em><br>(In the Name of Allah, the Merciful, the Compassionate)</p>
            <p>It is a great honor to contribute to Patuakhali Science and Technology University (PSTU) by developing the Hall Management System for Bijoy 24 Hall. This platform is designed to enhance administrative efficiency and improve the experience of both students and staff through digitization and user-friendly features.</p>
            <p>As a student and passionate developer of PSTU, my vision was to create a modern, secure, and effective system that simplifies tasks such as student registration, room application, payment tracking, and notice management. I sincerely hope this system serves the hall authority and students well in their day-to-day operations, reducing manual workload and encouraging transparency.</p>
            <p>I express my gratitude to the Provost and all respected teachers for their continuous support and inspiration. May this initiative play a small but meaningful role in the university's ongoing journey toward technological advancement and excellence in education.</p>
            <p><strong>Md. Abdul Hai Fahim</strong><br>Developer, Hall Management System<br>Student, CSE, PSTU</p>
